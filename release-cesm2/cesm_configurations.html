<p>The CESM system can be configured a number of different ways from both
a science and technical perspective. CESM supports numerous
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2.0/cesm/grids.html">resolutions</a>, and
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2.0/cesm/compsets.html">component sets</a>.  In
addition, each model component has input options to configure specific
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2.0/component_xml/index.html">model settings</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2.0/component_namelists/index.html">parameterizations</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="cesm2-components">
<h2>CESM2 Components<a class="headerlink" href="#cesm2-components" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>CESM2 consists of seven geophysical model components:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2.0/atmosphere">atmosphere (atm)</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2.0/sea-ice">sea-ice (ice)</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2.0/land">land (lnd)</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2.0/river">river (rof)</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2.0/ocean">ocean (ocn),</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2.0/land-ice">land-ice (glc)</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2.0/wave">ocean-wave (wav)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>and an external system processing component</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>external system processing (esp)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition CESM2 is accompanied by a <a class="reference external" href="http://esmci.github.io/cime/driver_cpl/index.html">driver/coupler (cpl7)</a> that coordinates
the time evolution of geophysical components and periocially permits
the components to exchange data.  Each component is represented in one
of several modes: &#8220;active,&#8221; &#8220;data,&#8221; &#8220;dead,&#8221; or &#8220;stub&#8221; that permits the
whole system to activate and deactive component feedbacks by allowing
for a variety of &#8220;plug and play&#8221; combinations.</p>
<p>During the course of a CESM run, the model components integrate forward
in time, periodically exchanging information with the coupler.
The coupler meanwhile receives fields from the component models,
computes, maps, and merges this information, then sends the fields back
to the component models. The coupler brokers this sequence of
communication interchanges and manages the overall time progression of
the coupled system. A CESM component set is comprised of eight
components: one component from each model (atm, lnd, rof, ocn, ice, glc,
wav, and esp) plus the coupler. Model components are written primarily in
Fortran.</p>
<p>The active (dynamical) components are generally fully prognostic, and
they are state-of-the-art climate prediction and analysis tools. Because
the active models are relatively expensive to run, data models that
cycle input data are included for testing, spin-up, and model
parameterization development. The dead components generate
scientifically invalid data and exist only to support technical system
testing. The dead components must all be run together and should never
be combined with any active or data versions of models. Stub components
exist only to satisfy interface requirements when the component is not
needed for the model configuration (e.g., the active land component
forced with atmospheric data does not need ice, ocn, or glc components,
so ice, ocn, and glc stubs are used).</p>
<p>The CESM2 components can be summarized as follows:</p>

<h2>CESM2 Component Sets<a class="headerlink" href="#cesm2-component-sets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The CESM2 components can be combined in numerous ways to carry out
various scientific or software experiments. A particular mix of
components, <em>along with</em> component-specific configuration and/or
namelist settings is called a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2.0/cesm/compsets.html">component set or compset</a>.  CESM
has a shorthand naming convention for component sets that are
supported out-of-the-box.</p>
<p>The compset name usually has a well defined first letter followed by
some characters that are indicative of the configuration setup. Each
compset name has a corresponding short name.</p>
<p>See <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2.0/cesm/compsets.html">supported component sets</a> for a
complete list of supported compset options. Running <strong>query_config</strong>
with the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--compsets</span></code> option will also provide a listing of the
supported out-of-the-box component sets for the local version of CESM.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cesm2-grids">
<h2>CESM2 Grids<a class="headerlink" href="#cesm2-grids" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2.0/cesm/grids.html">supported grid resolutions</a> are
specified in CESM by setting an overall model resolution.  Once the
overall model resolution is set, components will read in appropriate
grids files and the coupler will read in appropriate mapping weights
files. Coupler mapping weights are always generated externally in
CESM. The components will send the grid data to the coupler at
initialization, and the coupler will check that the component grids
are consistent with each other and with the mapping weights files.</p>
<p>In CESM2, the ocean and ice must be on the same grid, but the
atmosphere and land and river runoff can each be on different grids.
Each component determines its own unique grid decomposition based upon
the total number of pes or processing elements assigned to that component.</p>
<p>CESM supports several types of grids out-of-the-box including single
point, finite volume, cubed sphere, displaced pole, and
tripole. These grids are used internally by the
models. Input datasets are usually on the same grid but in some cases,
they can be interpolated from regular lon/lat grids in the data models.
The finite volume is generally associated with
atmosphere and land models but the data ocean and data ice models are
also supported on that grid. The cubed sphere grid is used only by the
active atmosphere model, cam. And the displaced pole and tripole grids
are used by the ocean and ice models. Not every grid can be run by every
component. The ocean and ice models run on either a Greenland dipole or
a tripole grid. The Greenland Pole grid is a
latitude/longitude grid, with the North Pole displaced over Greenland to
avoid singularity problems in the ocn and ice models. The low-resolution
Greenland pole mesh from CCSM3 is illustrated in <a class="reference external" href="http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/JCLI3744.1">Yeager et al., &#8220;The
Low-Resolution CCSM3&#8221;, AMS (2006), Figure 1b.,
Web.</a>
Similarly, the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm1.0/cesm/cesm_doc_1_0_4/x42.html">Poseidon tripole
grid</a> is a latitude/longitude
grid with three poles that are all centered over land.</p>

<div class="section" id="cesm2-machines">
<h2>CESM2 Machines<a class="headerlink" href="#cesm2-machines" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Scripts for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2.0/cesm/machines.html">supported machines</a> and
userdefined machines are provided with the CESM release. Supported
machines have machine specific files and settings added to the CESM
scripts and are machines that should run CESM cases
out-of-the-box. Machines are supported in CESM on an individual basis
and are usually listed by their common site-specific name. To get a
machine ported and functionally supported in CESM, local batch, run,
environment, and compiler information must be configured in the CESM
scripts. The machine name &#8220;userdefined&#8221; machines refer to any machine
that the user defines and requires that a user edit the resulting xml
files to fill in information required for the target platform. This
functionality is handy in accelerating the porting process and quickly
getting a case running on a new platform. For more information on
porting, see the <a class="reference external" href="http://esmci.github.io/cime/users_guide/porting-cime.html">CIME porting guide</a>.  The
list of available machines are documented in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2.0/cesm/machines.html">CESM supported machines</a>.
Running <strong>query_config</strong> with the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--machines</span></code> option will also show
the list of all machines for the current local version of
CESM. Supported machines have undergone the full CESM porting
process. The machines available in each of these categories changes as
access to machines change over time.</p>

<div class="section" id="cesm2-validation">
<h2>CESM2 Validation<a class="headerlink" href="#cesm2-validation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Although CESM can be run out-of-the-box for a variety of resolutions,
component combinations, and machines, MOST combinations of component
sets, resolutions, and machines have not undergone rigorous scientific
climate validation. Control runs accompany <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/scientifically-supported.html">scientifically supported</a>
component sets and resolutions and are documented on the release page.
These control runs should be scientifically reproducible on the
original platform or other platforms. Bit-for-bit reproducibility
cannot be guaranteed due to variations in compiler or system
versions. Users should carry out their own <a class="reference external" href="http://esmci.github.io/cime/users_guide/porting-cime.html#validating-your-port">port validations</a>
on any platform prior to doing scientific runs or scientific analysis
and documentation.</p>
