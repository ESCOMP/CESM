The latest-production sym link should point to the directory containing
the documentation for the latest production release. This is not
necessarily the latest release: see
http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/about/support.html for definition of production
releases. Note that the description of this latest production release is
given in versions.json, so if you update the link, you should also
update the line in that file that looks like this:
    "latest-production": "Latest Production Release (CESM2.1)",
