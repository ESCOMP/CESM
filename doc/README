Use the following commands to auto-build the html documentation from the main
cesm/doc directory:

>make clean
>make html

The build/html files should be copied to the appropriate release or
development https://github.com/ESCOMP/CESM gh-pages orphan branch
subdirectory and commited to that branch separately.

Only the doc/source files are stored with the code on the master
branch.
